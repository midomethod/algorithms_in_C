Recursive codes using a stack
C. Seshadhri, Jan 2020

The file basically contains two functions that generate all subsequences of an input string. One function is the (standard) recursive method,
while the other is non-recursive and uses a stack. Both these functions have an identical output, and create a (linked) list of strings as their output.

The code uses the List data structure used in a number of CSE101 assignments and tests.

USAGE:  (the executable is generated by a Makefile)
    ./stackrecursion <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>

    Only the first line of <INPUT FILE> is read, as a string. <OUTPUT FILE> contains all subsequences, each in a separate line.
----------------------------------------------

Files:

list.cpp, list.h, node.cpp, node.h: These are linked list codes.
stackrecursion.cpp: The main file that contains the subsequence generating functions
Makefile: Well, that's the makefile
README: You're reading it right now.
